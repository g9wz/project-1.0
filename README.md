## Reviving My First Web Project 💡 <sup>April, 2023<sup>

This was my very first web project ever. It was initially created for a web design course at my university.

Honestly, I have no idea about what it is supposed to be lol, but I've decided to revive it 😊

I Was trying to achieve the requested criteria, and this is what I - we in this case - got <3

## Over-Engineered❓

Pretty much for a static one-page application.

But, as they say:

> "It's not about the journey; it's about the friends you have made along the way."

The friends in this context are [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), & [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) <sup>(honorable mention)</sup>

P.S. It could have been a whole lot more complicated 😵
